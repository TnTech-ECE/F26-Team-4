#  Measures Of Success

The success of this project will be based on the time source's ability to provide reliable time in hostile and normal conditions. The following Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) will be used to determine whether the system meets the technical, timing, and security requirements.

***1. Timing and Synchronization Accuracy***

Objective: Verify that the system can maintain accurate time reference using external sources while delivering it to clients.

Methodology:

- Reference accuracy: Compare the system's output to a trusted time source to confirm correctness.
- Synchronization accuracy: Compare the system's oscillator to the time sources over a period.
- Timing Stability: Observe the error of the system to identify drift or other variations.
- Longterm stability: Operate the system over a period of time to determine whether the system can maintain synchronicity.
- Time Verification: Determine whether clients downstream are receiving the correct time, and is stable.

***2. GPS Reliability***

Objective: Verify whether the system can reliably acquire signals and accurately acquire timestamps.

Methodology:

- Initial Acquisition: Measure the time it takes for the module to acquire a signal from a cold start.
- Signal Strength: Measure the performance of the system under varying signal strengths and antenna conditions.
- Satellite Availability: Test the system over a variation in satellite number, and evaluate the minimum conditions for accurate acquisition.
- Tracking: Determine whether the system can maintain a lock with synchronization.
- Restart Testing: Test whether the system can cycle power and acquire a signal and gain synchronization.
- Antenna Testing: Determine whether the antenna and cabling can provide a quality signal over a period of time.

***3. Holdover Performance***

Objective: Verify the signal can provide accurate timestamps without a time source

Methodology:

- Time Source Interruption: Intentionally interrupt the signal and measure the timing error as the system transitions to using the internal oscillator.
- Duration: Determine how long the system can maintain accurate timestamps without a time reference.
- Oscillator Stability: Determine oscillator drift and its effect on time accuracy.
- Recovery Testing: Provide a valid time reference and measure whether the synchronization is correct quickly so not to produce time discontinuation.
- Repeated Time Source Interruption: Repeatedly disconnect and reconnect a signal and verify consistency.

***4. Network Time Distribution***

Objective: Verify that a externally disciplined time source can accurately distribute timestamps to clients.

Methodology:

- NTP Synchronization: Connect multiple clients and verify that each client receives the correct timestamps.
- Network Testing: Test synchronization under varying network loads and communication delays.
- Client Scalability: Increase the number of clients and determine whether increased traffic affects performance.
- Timestamp Accuracy: Compare timestamps received by timestamps against a valid reference to determine timing error.
- Continuous Operation: Observe timestamps transmission over a period of time to determine synchronization remains accurate.

***5. Security and Robustness***

Objective: Verify that the time source is robust against external attacks such as spoofing and DOS attacks, as well as attacks like jamming.

Methodology:

- Configuration Security: Verify only authorized users can modify timing, network and system parameters.
- Network Security: Evaluate the system's resistance to unauthorized NTP requests, configuration access, and other network based attacks.
- Time Integrity: Verify unexpected changes in the reference time or time source is logged.
- Authentication: Ensure that administrative action and protected services require proper authentication.
- Event Logging: Verify that significant events including time source loss, synchronization changes, configuration changes, and system failures are logged for future analysis.
- Failure Response: When the integrity of the external time sources cannot be verified, ensure the system enters a safe operating mode.

***6. Power Efficiency and Reliability***

Objective: Verify that the time source can operate while maintaining safe electrical and thermal performance.

Methodology:

- Power Consumption: Measure Power consumption of the system during startup, normal conditions, and holdover conditions.
- Continuous Operation: Test the system for a predefined period of time to identify unexpected resets, power failures , and other reliability issues.
- Thermal Testing: Monitor temperatures of the oscillator, SoC, GPS Modules, miscellaneous modules, and power circuitry during extended operation.
- Power Interruption Testing: Perform controlled power interruptions, and verify the system properly transitions to backup power sources , and maintains synchronization.
- Power Supply Verification: Confirm that the power supply provides stable voltage and current under expected operating conditions.
